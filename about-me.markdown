My name is Campbell Vertesi, and I do a lot of things.

Most relevant to this website is my technical history. I've been working with computers for 17 years, with Drupal for 8 of those. I started doing desktop repair, and moved into sysadmin work after the first few years. I spent 5 years as a full time system administrator for large universities, and then discovered Drupal 4.4. I remember being blown away by the first *real* open source CMS I had ever seen. Since then I've been in most roles in the Drupal ecosystem: coder, themer, project manager, information architect, technical lead, CEO, and CTO. I've presented at 4 Drupalcons, and in Portland and Prague I got to help lead the opening session. I presently work as a Technical Architect for [Forum One Communications](http://forumone.com "Forum One Communications), where I get to help great organizations handle tough technological challenges.

If you met me in real life though, you probably wouldn't find out about all that very quickly. Maybe first you'd learn that I'm also a professional opera singer, leading member of the opera group [The Cast](http://the-cast.de "The Cast") in Germany. I speak English, French, Italian, and German, and I love to travel. Apart from a plethora of short term hobbies--I love to learn anything new, so I get hobbies like most people get colds, and for just as long--I nurture a side passion for martial arts. I actively study *Tae Kwon-Do* and *Ninjutsu*.
