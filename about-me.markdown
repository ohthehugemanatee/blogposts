My name is [Campbell Vertesi](http://campbell.vertesi.com/), and I'm an [opera singer](http://thecastmusic.com/) and a web developer.

Most relevant to this website is my technical history. I've been working with computers for 18 years, with Drupal for 11 of those. I started with desktop repair, moved into sysadmin work, and eventually discovered Drupal 4.4. I started doing desktop repair, and moved into sysadmin work after the first few years. I remember being blown away by the first *real* open source CMS I had ever seen. Since then I've been in most roles in the Drupal ecosystem: coder, themer, project manager, information architect, technical lead, CEO, and CTO. I've presented at more than 10 Drupalcons, where I'm particularly known as an author of the "prenote" opening sessions. I've been a Drupalist for 12 years, a Linux administrator for 17, and now I'm a freelance full-stack web developer. My specialty has always been in non-profits; my favorite organizations that I've worked with have been the [Jane Goodall Institute](http://www.janegoodall.org/ "Jane Goodall Institute"), the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/ "Mozilla Foundation"), the [EPA](http://epa.org "the EPA"), the [United Way](http://unitedway.org "United Way"), and [Oxfam International](http://oxfam.org).

The rest of the stuff I do is scattered around the Internet and real life. I'm a professional opera singer, leading member of the opera group [The Cast](http://thecastmusic.com "The Cast") in Germany. I speak English, French, Italian, and German, and I love to travel. I love to learn anything new, so I get hobbies like most people get colds, and for just as long. I also nurture a long term interest in martial arts. I actively study *Tae Kwon-Do* and *Bujinkan Ninjutsu*. You can find out more about me at [campbell.vertesi.com](http://campbell.vertesi.com/).
