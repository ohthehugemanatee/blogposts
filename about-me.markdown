My name is Campbell Vertesi, and I do a lot of things. I'm an [opera singer](http://thecastmusic.com/), an open source evangelist, a martial arts student, and a web developer.

Most relevant to this website is my technical history. I've been working with computers for 18 years, with Drupal for 10 of those. I started doing desktop repair, and moved into sysadmin work after the first few years. I spent 5 years as a full time system administrator for large universities, and then discovered Drupal 4.4. I remember being blown away by the first *real* open source CMS I had ever seen. Since then I've been in most roles in the Drupal ecosystem: coder, themer, project manager, information architect, technical lead, CEO, and CTO. I've presented at 6 Drupalcons, and in the last 4 I got to help lead the "prenote" opening session. I presently work as a Technical Architect and Lead Evangelist for [Forum One](http://forumone.com "Forum One"), where I get to help great organizations handle tough technological challenges. My favorite organizations that I've worked with have been the [Jane Goodall Institute](http://www.janegoodall.org/ "Jane Goodall Institute"), the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/ "Mozilla Foundation"), the [EPA](http://epa.org "the EPA"), and the [United Way](http://unitedway.org "United Way").

The rest of the stuff I do is scattered around the Internet and real life. I'm a professional opera singer, leading member of the opera group [The Cast](http://the-cast.de "The Cast") in Germany. I speak English, French, Italian, and German, and I love to travel. I love to learn anything new, so I get hobbies like most people get colds, and for just as long. I also nurture a long term interest in martial arts. I actively study *Tae Kwon-Do* and *Bujinkan Ninjutsu*.
