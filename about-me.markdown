My name is [Campbell Vertesi](http://campbell.vertesi.com/); I'm a technical architect with [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/ "Microsoft"), and an [opera singer](https://thecastmusic.com/).

I've been working with computers for 21 years, with Drupal for 13 of those. I started with desktop repair, moved into sysadmin work, and eventually discovered Drupal 4.1. Since then I've been in most roles in the web consultant ecosystem: coder, themer, project manager, information architect, technical lead, CEO, and CTO. I've presented at almost 20 Drupalcons, where I'm particularly known as an author of the "prenote" opening sessions. 

I've been fortunate enough to work with great organizations like [the Jane Goodall Institute](http://www.janegoodall.org/ "Jane Goodall Institute"), the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/ "Mozilla Foundation"), the [EPA](http://epa.org "the EPA"), the [United Way](http://unitedway.org "United Way"), and [Oxfam International](http://oxfam.org). I've helped out big commercial organizations like [Intel](https://intel.com/ "Intel") and [Ringier Axel Springer](http://www.ringieraxelspringer.com/en "Ringier Axel Springer"). I contribute to many open source projects along the way.

The rest of the stuff I do is scattered around the Internet and real life. I'm co-founder of the opera band [The Cast](https://thecastmusic.com "The Cast"), bringing crowds to their feet with awesome classical music. I speak English, French, Italian, and German, and I love to travel. I love to learn anything new, so I get hobbies like most people get colds. I also nurture a long term interest in martial arts, particularly *Tae Kwon-Do* and *Bujinkan Ninjutsu*. You can find out more about me and these other interests at [campbell.vertesi.com](http://campbell.vertesi.com/).
