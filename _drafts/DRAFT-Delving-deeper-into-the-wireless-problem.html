With some help from the nice folk at the DD-WRT forums, I did some further troubleshooting. &nbsp;Turns out the ping spikes do not happen over a wired connection, and hey happen - here's the big part - with any wifi router I try.<br /><br />This meant signal interference. &nbsp;Something, somewhere was causing a burst of interference every 90 seconds. I gave up to cry under my bed. &nbsp;Signal interference is a bitch to pin down, under the best of circumstances!<br /><br />Then I moved apartments. I now live in a farm house, literally in the middle of nowhere. &nbsp;I am the only wireless provider in range - indeed, the nearest village is more than 5km away. &nbsp;Sweet, sweet wireless silence. &nbsp;So I ran my ping test again... and I still get dropouts every 90 seconds.<br /><br />This means that *I* am the cause of the interference. &nbsp;Something I own bursts wifi interference every 90 seconds. &nbsp;I'm now running around my house, frantically shutting down everything I can to figure out what is causing the problem.<br /><br />With all my electronics turned off, even my iphone... I still get the ping drops.
