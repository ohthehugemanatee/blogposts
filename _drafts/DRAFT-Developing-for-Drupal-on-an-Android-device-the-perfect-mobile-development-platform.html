<div><p>This post is not about applications for Android using the Drupal platform. It's not about integrating Drupal and Android. I know, those make up the majority of search results with these keywords, because I've looked. This post is about <b>using your Android device as the perfect Drupal development platform.</b></p><p><b>THE HARDWARE</b></p><p>Technically, everything in this post will work with ANY Android device. But why you would want to develop on your mobile phone is beyond me. I recommend building this out on an ASUS Transformer TF300T. I'm going to go out on a limb and call it <b>the perfect mobile development device for a Drupal developer, System Administrator, and/or PHP-head on the go</b>. It's fast, slick, extremely light, extremely cheap - and it will do everything you need it to do to get your work done on the road.</p><p>The ASUS Transformer TF300T is the recent re-imagining of the popular transformer series of tablets. It's an Android tablet with an optional keyboard dock, and a $500 price tag (including keyboard dock). It packs almost all the punch of a top of the line Android "ice cream sandwich" tablet: a quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor, 4GB of RAM,&#160; an excellent display, and an 8 megapixel camera. I'm not a hardware reviewer - those guys have to deal with things like review models arriving on their doorsteps, and enormous bribes from manufacturers. Instead, I recommend you check out the reviews from the sources <b>I</b> trust: Anandtech and Tom's Hardware.</p><p><b>LOCAL DEVELOPMENT</b> </p><p>The first thing to do is set up a local development environment. One powerful option is the application Terminal IDE, available from the app store. It drops you into a bash shell with many of the command line utilities you rely on. Technically it's geared towards Java development, but git, ssh, and vim are useful for any developer. But there are limitations: Terminal IDE relies on Android's built in environment, and that makes for some odd workarounds. For example, most programs cannot resolve DNS names from the command line. And the /etc/hosts file effectively doesn't exist. And SSH is based on the DropBear SSH library, which doesn't auto-detect public/private keypairs or support ssh-config; this breaks git keypair authentication. </p><p>Basically, I found it a great shortcut to a workable command line environment with vim. But it's not enough for serious work, and forget about niceties like serving Drupal locally, or any of the development niceties you're used to with Linux.</p><p>The alternative is to get a proper, working Linux environment going on the device. There are smart people working hard on getting Ubuntu running natively on the TF300T, but my experience with this sort of project is that it's more trouble than it's worth. More to the point, they don't support all the behaviors of the device yet, so I recommend running linux in a virtualized environment. Yes, the new generation of devices has plenty of power to run a virtualized Ubuntu environment! There are caveats, but they all revolve around the GUI. It can still be done fairly easily with a GUI, but I recommend going more pared down. You can easily get an Ubuntu "small" image running, which offers a full terminal environment that can offer services like HTTP and MySQL in the "reserved" port range.</p></div>
