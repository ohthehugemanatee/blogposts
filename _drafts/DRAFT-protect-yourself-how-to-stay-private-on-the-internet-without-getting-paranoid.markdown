In the last year, we've learned the truth behind the old phrase: *Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they aren't watching you.* The Snowden leaks proved to the world - and continue proving - that mass surveillance isn't the sole province of dictatorships. It's actually a basic ongoing program in most wealthy, democratic countries. 

Of course we learned about the specific programs of the NSA, but peripherally we learned that France was doing the same thing. And Germany. Oh, and Great Britain is even worse. And worst of all, they all share information with each other. 

This is a great "I Told You So" moment for security professionals and paranoids the world over. And it's also a big wake up call for normal people who like to use the Internet. Time to learn the first rule of Internet Privacy:

You're being tracked, no matter what you do
===

> "Want to evade NSA Spying? Don't connect to the Internet" -- Bruce Schneier

The first thing to know is that if you're online, people are trying to track you. There is so much value in (aggregate) behavioral and demographic information that everyone and their mother is trying to figure out what you do online. Try and think of a single entity or even person who would have zero interest in knowing what everyone does online. The list of people for whom surveillance holds value is enormous:

* your government.
* other governments.
* mafias.
* advertisers.
* anyone who wants to sell you anything.
* your parents.
* espionage agencies.
* security professionals.
* the blind date you have coming up on Friday.

I can go on. But literally everyone and their mother has some kind of interest in knowing what you do. That means a *tremendous* market demand exists, and a tremendous set of industries exist to fill that demand. The demand of your mother and the blind date are big parts of what Facebook offers people. Governments or mafias are interested in different information.

The point is that for a variety of reasons, there is always someone trying to track you online. So **Treat every communication on the Internet as if it's being logged.**

This rule alone will keep you sane. But I'm sure most of you are looking for tools, not philosophy. So here are my practical methods for staying relatively secure from bulk surveillance.

Protection from governments
===

Caveat: if a large, well resourced organization like a government wants access to your digital life, they are going to get it. No generic guide is going to help you there. So if you're a target of interest, IMO you're basically screwed. As most (honest) security researchers will tell you, a dedicated attacker _will_ get around any security you set up. Good practice lies in detection and response to that situation.

This guide is about protecting yourself from *bulk* surveillance, however. That's a much easier task.

Prefer open source tools
---

A big revelation from the Snowden documents is that the NSA and similar organizations put backdoors into lots of proprietary products. We know about backdoors in Microsoft and Apple products, for example. The only way to protect yourself is by using open source, peer-reviewed products. Note that this isn't perfect protection, but it's a lot better than the black box. This means:

* Prefer Firefox or Opera over Chrome
* Prefer OpenOffice for any sensitive documents
* Prefer vanilla Android (or Cyanogenmod) over your manufacturer's provided phone OS.
* Prefer Linux over OSX, and OSX over Windows

How extreme you want to go is going to depend on your personal sense of the tradeoffs between security and convenience. I still use OSX and MSOffice, for example. But I use Firefox and Cyanogenmod everywhere. The point is to give you a framework for choosing software: prefer open source.

Prefer encryption
---

Whenever possible, enable encryption. Not all encryption is created equal, but almost anything will be enough to protect you from bulk surveillance. This means:

* Use Adium or Jitsi for chat, so you can enable OTR encryption in your regular chats.
* Use the HTTPS Everywhere Firefox extension, so your web browsing is encrypted when possible.
* Use a VPN like Riseup or a private provider to protect your traffic.



Protection from advertisers

Advertisers are a major source of tracking on the Internet. Fortunately, it's relatively easy to get around.

Protection from social media trackers

Social media sites are a major
