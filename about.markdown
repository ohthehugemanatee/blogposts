This is a blog that's partly a reference for myself, partly as a pointer for all the instructions I end up writing for others, and partly a document of my technical history. I'm someone who is involved in a lot of different fields and specialties, and it's nice to have it all catalogued somewhere. I've written this blog on various platforms under different names (swearingatcomputers, mostly), but this is where I'm hoping it will stay for awhile.

I'm not responsible for any damage caused to yourself, your family, your friends, your pets, or anything else as the result of using this information. Be smart and be careful.
