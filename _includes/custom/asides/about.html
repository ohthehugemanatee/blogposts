<h1>About</h1>
  <p>This is a blog that&rsquo;s partly a reference for myself, partly as a pointer for all the instructions I end up writing for others, and partly a document of my technical history. I&rsquo;m someone who is involved in a lot of different fields and specialties, and it&rsquo;s nice to have it all catalogued somewhere. I&rsquo;ve written this blog on various platforms under different names (swearingatcomputers, mostly), but this is where I&rsquo;m hoping it will stay for awhile.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible for any damage caused to yourself, your family, your friends, your pets, or anything else as the result of using this information. Be smart and be careful.</p>
