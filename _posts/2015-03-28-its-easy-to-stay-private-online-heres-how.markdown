The Internet is not a private place. It's a public medium, where anyone can read anyone else's transmissions. That's how it was designed, but on that platform we built a lot of services that look and feel like they should be private. Email, chat, web browsing - most people think that these are private activities.

They aren't. Email is as private as a postcard, delivered by a handful of strangers you've never met. Anyone in your neighborhood with the same Internet provider can see what webpages you visit, or what you do on chat. Every keystroke, every single click you make. It's all public. That's how the Internet works.

When Edward Snowden started to reveal the extent of the American NSA's data collection, most people thought of it as spying. The truth is they are mostly collecting information that was already public anyway. Lots of people were already collecting it. Your Internet provider has been selling your browser history for years, as has google, as have a whole slew of advertising companies you've never heard of.

This doesn't mean you have to stop using the Internet. It means that you have to learn the easy tools that protect your privacy in this public medium. Just because a postcard is easy to read doesn't mean you shouldn't use the postal service! It just means you should learn how to use envelopes.

In this post I'll give you 4 simple tools that make it easy for anyone - yes, anyone - to protect their privacy online. You can use email, chat, and websites in a way that keeps your information private from everyone: your Internet provider, advertisers, even the NSA.

*This is a normal person's guide to privacy tools. It is not intended for political dissidents, or people who might be otherwise specifically targeted for surveillance. It is intended for everyday citizens to protect their information from bulk surveillance, like that conducted by the American NSA, advertisers, or google.*

_1) Protect your browser history from wiretaps_

Most websites offer a way to connect securely, foiling any attempt to wiretap your Internet connection to collect your browser history. It's called HTTPS (the S stands for Secure), and you usually see it as a little lock in the address bar of your web browser.

There are add-ons for most browsers that try HTTPS automatically on every website you visit. Step one for your privacy is to install one of them. Choose the link below for whatever browser you use, and follow the instructions to install the add-on.

_2) Protect your browser history from tracking devices_

Websites are allowed to leave little tracking markers on web browsers that visit them. This is how most websites keep you logged in - you enter your username and password, and the site leaves a little marker in your browser that identifies you. Every time you use that website, your browser sends the marker code to the website, and the site gets customized for you. This is really important for sites like Amazon or Facebook, where you really do want to be logged in.

The problem is, lots of those companies also have code on OTHER sites, which is designed to report back about every site your marker code visits. Every time you see a facebook "like" or "share" button, it is secretly reporting back to Facebook that you visited that page.
