About a month and a half ago, I left my position at [Forum One](https://forumone.com) to start working with [Amazee Labs](https://amazeelabs.com). Yes, a month and a half is an eternity in Internet-Time, but better to blog about it late than not at all!

I loved my position at Forum One. I got to work with worthwhile clients like [Oxfam](www.oxfam.org) and [United Way](www.unitedway.org), I got to solve interesting and tricky Drupal problems, and I got to work with some truly brilliant colleagues. I strongly recommend it as a great place to work. But it was always a challenge dealing with my visa situation (contrary to popular belief, I am Canadian - NOT American!), and despite heroic efforts we just couldn't find a way to make a permanent relationship work.

Drupal is an interesting field in which to work, and there's a lot of momentum for good developers. I chose to work with Amazee Labs because they are some of the best at what we do. I've always been a fan of their work on a technical level, and now, getting to be a part of the team is very exciting. 

My portfolio at Amazee is basically to work on their cutting edge project work. So right now I'm on a special project with brilliant Drupalists [fubhy](https://www.drupal.org/u/fubhy) and [Moshe Weitzman](https://www.drupal.org/u/moshe-weitzman), mixing Drupal 8 with a custom data storage backend, and serving it up via graphql to many server side ReactJS sites. The whole thing is developed, tested, and run in production on Docker. I've gotten to flex muscles I didn't know I had, working with this really cutting edge stack. I will definitely be posting more about the technical issues I encounter along the way.

Of course, one of the most appealing parts of this job is the flexibility to continue pursuing my other passion in music. The Cast is getting bigger and bigger, with 30-40 shows this year. I'm really working hard to balance these two parts of my life, and the trajectory of The Cast ensures that this balance will be a big focus for me in the next several years. I don't want to leave open source tech entirely; but I may scale back my conference visibility, and focus my contributions more. We'll see what happens. No matter what, I'm happy to be working with a fantastic team and supportive company. On to amazeeng things together!
