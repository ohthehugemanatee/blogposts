One of the best parts of Drupal 8 is our shift to enterprise PHP coding structures. With tools like composer and Symfony's structures like Events and Dependency Injection, Drupalists are learning to be great PHP developers, and vice-versa. Today, the fastest route to becoming a rock star Drupalist is through PHP.

I'm one of the PHP track chairs for Drupalcon Vienna, and this year our focus is *better PHP === better Drupalists*. How can better PHP make your life as a Drupal developer easier?

<!-- more --> 

**Do you like PHP 7?** We want to hear about the technicalities of types, throwing all the things, and your favorite operators (mine is null coalesce, but full respect for you spaceship operator fans). 

**Have you seen the light of functional programming?** Tell us why we should love higher orders with lambda functions and closures. Let's hear the finer points of first class functions.

**Do your tests bring all the bugs to the yard?** We want to talk about it. Every method is a promise, and your tests make sure you keep your promises. We want sessions about test driven development in a drupal context, choosing the right test framework and scope, and how your real-world tests are saving you real-world time.

**Have you written a composer library wrapper module yet?** Submit a session about how composer is saving you lines of code.

**Is your development environment fine-tuned for drupal excellence?** Tell us how, and why.

We have only two weeks left until session submissions close! [Get your session in now](https://events.drupal.org/node/add/session?og_group_ref=14447) and help us make Drupal code something to be proud of.
