After <a href="http://swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com/2010/12/unlocking-and-jailbreaking-my-iphone.html">wasting my evening</a> working out a jailbreak/unlock for an old version of IOS, I discovered a side note in a <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1718400992/ultra-recycle">devteam blog update</a>&nbsp;that gave me clues on how to jailbreak and unlock my phones for the latest version of IOS. &nbsp;So I spent another evening working on that. <br /><br />I haven't seen complete instructions anywhere yet, so here they are. &nbsp;How to update your iPhone 3GS to 4.2.1, jailbreak, and unlock it for multiple carriers. &nbsp;(for Mac)<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Download the IOS 4.2.1 firmware, either over P2P or using iTunes. &nbsp;To download using iTunes, accept it's prompt to get the latest firmware, but "download only." &nbsp;This firmware file will be called&nbsp;iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a_Restore.ipsw , and you can find it using your computer's find utility. &nbsp;On a Mac, it will be in ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates &nbsp;(~ is shorthand for your home folder. Click the blue happy face in the bar on the bottom of your screen if you are confused).</li><li>Download and install the latest version of <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1359246784/20102010-event">Pwnagetool</a>&nbsp;(4.1 as of this writing) from the <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1718400992/ultra-recycle">devteam blog</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li><li>Pwnagetool does not yet have a framework for working with the 4.2.1 firmware. &nbsp;To add that framework, first download it from <a href="http://iphwn.org/advanced/iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a.bundle.zip">iphwn.org</a>. &nbsp; Extract this file to get a .bundle , which is what pwnagetool needs to work with this IOS version.&nbsp;</li><li>Right click on your pwnagetool "app" in OSX and choose "Show Package Contents." &nbsp;Look in Contents &gt; Resources &gt; FirmwareBundles . &nbsp;See all those .bundle files, named for each version of IOS? &nbsp;That's where you should put the 4.2.1 .bundle you just downloaded.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ukp9db12h9g/TQ6txreow-I/AAAAAAAAAAM/EEqzeqHYQ2k/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-12-20+at+2.13.13+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="264" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ukp9db12h9g/TQ6txreow-I/AAAAAAAAAAM/EEqzeqHYQ2k/s320/Screen+shot+2010-12-20+at+2.13.13+AM.png" width="320" /></a></div></li><li>Now start up Pwnagetool, select "expert" mode, and browse for your vanilla 4.2.1 firmware that you downloaded from iTunes. &nbsp;Before compiling your custom firmware, hit the button for "General" options, and uncheck the box for "activate." &nbsp;Sorry, activation has to be done in a separate step. &nbsp;Now go ahead and build that custom firmware!</li><li>Follow Pwnagetool's instructions to get your iphone into DFU mode, and then use iTunes to restore to your custom firmware. &nbsp;If you haven't done this before, you have to Option+click the "restore" button, then browse to the new custom firmware, which should be named something like iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a_Custom_Restore.ipsw . <br /><br />Some of you may ask, but if we aren't activating via Pwnagetool, then what's the difference? &nbsp;The custom firmware only includes the 4.2.1 SYSTEM. &nbsp;It doesn't include the new, hack-proof baseband. &nbsp;The baseband is the part of your phone that actually communicates with the cellular network. &nbsp;Think of it like your modem firmware, it's pretty close.&nbsp;</li><li>Now you have to activate your phone! &nbsp;Download and install the latest version of <a href="http://wikee.iphwn.org/howto:rs9#download_links">Redsn0w</a>. &nbsp;I found the devteam link was broken, so I got it from <a href="http://www.iphoneworld.ca/news/2010/12/04/download-redsn0w-0-9-6b6-iphone-jailbreak-now-with-sam-support-windows-mac/">here</a>.</li><li>Run Redsn0w. &nbsp;When it asks you for your firmware ipsw, browse to the VANILLA version of 4.2.1 that you got through iTunes. &nbsp;Make sure you check the box for "Install Cydia" when prompted, and follow the instructions closely! &nbsp;This will activate your phone. &nbsp;Now all we have to do is unlock!</li><li>On your iphone, connect to a wireless network and start the Cydia application. &nbsp;Go to the "Manage" tab along the bottom, and tap the big "Sources" button. &nbsp;Add a new source, at URL http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com . &nbsp;Now go to the search tab, and search for ultrasn0w. &nbsp;Install it, and restart your iphone.</li></ol><div>Voila! &nbsp;One bona fide, jailbroken, unlocked, activated iphone 3GS on 4.2.1! &nbsp;Now, don't come crying to me when your battery starts running down.</div>
