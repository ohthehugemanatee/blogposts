<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I got called in for an interesting issue on one of the servers I co-maintain today. &nbsp;Sites were messing up left right and center, in all sorts of bizarre ways. &nbsp;CSS wouldn't be delivered, or half of it would be, or some of the content would disappear... and different on every page load! &nbsp;It only took me a moment to confirm - the server was out of space on the root device.<br /><br />This was readily visible in the logs - any mysql transaction you tried would return "Got error 28 from storage engine", which typically means the drive is out of space. &nbsp;And a quick <code>df -ht</code> confirmed:<br /><br /><blockquote><code><br />root@production:/# df -h<br />Filesystem &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Size &nbsp;Used Avail Use% Mounted on<br />/dev/sda1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.9G &nbsp;9.4G &nbsp;160K 100% /<br />none &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7.3G &nbsp;128K &nbsp;7.3G &nbsp; 1% /dev<br />none &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; 0% /dev/shm<br />none &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; 76K &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; 1% /var/run<br />none &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; 0% /var/lock<br />none &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp;7.6G &nbsp; 0% /lib/init/rw<br />/dev/sdb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;414G &nbsp;5.9G &nbsp;387G &nbsp; 2% /mnt<br />/dev/sdf &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50G &nbsp;8.8G &nbsp; 42G &nbsp;18% /ebs</code></blockquote><div><br /></div><div>Yep, /dev/sda1 was at 100% . &nbsp;So I ran through the usual suspects, and tracked it down to /var/log pretty quickly:</div><div><br /></div><blockquote><code><br /><div>root@production:/var# du -h |grep G</div><div>7.2G ./log</div><div>7.8G . </div></code></blockquote><div><br /></div><div>Sweet noodly goodness, 7 gigs of logs? &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><blockquote><code><div>root@production:/var/log# ls -lh |grep G</div><div>total 6.6G</div><div>-rw-r----- 1 syslog &nbsp; &nbsp;adm &nbsp;2.2G 2011-05-20 18:51 mail.info</div><div>-rw-r----- 1 syslog &nbsp; &nbsp;adm &nbsp;2.2G 2011-05-20 18:51 mail.log</div></code></blockquote><div><br /></div></div><div>Specifically, the mail logs were taking up all the space. &nbsp;The first order of business was to get them off the root device, so I moved them to /mnt , the freebie extra-ethereal EBS volume that Amazon gives you with every S3 instance. &nbsp;Then I could restart mysql/apache2, and at least the sites would be back up and normal. So what was going on in these logs?</div><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><code><br />root@production:/var/log# tail /mnt/mail.log <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGv30H001061: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:53, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGuuWt000738: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:55:00, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGvCZe001480: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:44, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGuf9L032603: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:55:15, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGv5qh001300: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:51, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGvPKQ002038: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:31, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGvHfI001678: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:39, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGvMxj001908: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:34, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=13980000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com. <br /><br />May 20 18:51:56 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4JGvHgB001693: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=1+01:54:3May 20 18:53:11 ip-10-118-81-22 sm-mta[21749]: p4FJ5XYp028180: to=&lt;www-data@production.swearing.com&gt;, delay=4+23:40:11, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp, pri=64650000, relay=production.swearing.com., dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with production.swearing.com.<br /><div><br /></div></code></blockquote><div>OK, clearly something is looping delivery failures. &nbsp;This server hosts several websites, without their accompanying email, so it's configured to force an MX lookup before attempting to send anything anywhere. &nbsp;But it doesn't receive mail, so it would have just timed out waiting for itself to respond.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is a problem, but that's a condition that should never happen. &nbsp;So what on earth would make it try to &nbsp;deliver mail to production.swearing.com? &nbsp;I headed over to the mail queue to see. &nbsp;The output of mailq was enormous, and I had to Ctrl+C it partway through. &nbsp;Every record was "Deferred" due to a timeout on production.swearing.com . &nbsp; OK, so clearly there's a lot in the queue. &nbsp;So I had a look at some of the messages.</div><div><br /></div><blockquote><code><br /><div><div>root@production:/var/spool/mqueue# cat dfp4I0uHUF025487&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is a MIME-encapsulated message</div><div><br /></div><div>--p4I0uHUF025487.1305680177/ip-10-118-81-22.ec2.internal</div><div><br /></div><div>The original message was received at Wed, 18 May 2011 00:56:14 GMT</div><div>from localhost [127.0.0.1]</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----</div><div>&lt;asf@gmail.com&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (reason: 550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist.

Now hopefully I got all the spammy addresses out of that contact form... or servers@swearing.com is gonna have a lot of mail waiting on Monday!<div><div id="wiki_add_attachment" style="color: #484848; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"></div></div>
