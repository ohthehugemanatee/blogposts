<a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> is a fantastic project management tool for technically oriented organizations. &nbsp;At my job, we use it to manage 30-50 active projects at a time, as well as the back history of several hundred projects. &nbsp;Oddly enough, the <a href="http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineInstall">normal installation process</a> puts it on port 3000 . &nbsp;We had some trouble with developers' ISPs not allowing HTTPS traffic over non-standard ports, so we had to move redmine onto port 443 along with the rest of the SSL traffic. &nbsp;We use the same hostname for several internal services, and differentiate by subdirectory - so I thought I'd just put redmine into another subdirectory.<br /><br />This was more painful than I expected it to be.  According to examples in the Redmine forums and many referring blog posts, you should be able to do this with a simple vhost configuration:<br /><blockquote><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br />&nbsp; ServerName swearing.com<br />&nbsp; DocumentRoot /var/www/html <br /><br />&nbsp; PassengerAppRoot /var/www/html/redmine<br />&nbsp; RailsBaseURI /redmine<br />&nbsp; Alias /redmine /var/www/html/redmine/public<br />&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></blockquote>I'm leaving out the SSL stuff, because that's irrelevant here.  The objective is to run redmine in a subdirectory, on no matter what port. :)<br /><br />From my reading of this configuration, we're telling Passenger that it's application starts at /var/www/html/redmine , Rails that it should only manage URLs below /redmine , and Apache that /redmine is an alias for the public directory inside Redmine. &nbsp;To me, this makes sense.<br /><br />But there's something a little funny about PassengerAppRoot and RailsBaseURI , because Redmine tried to serve EVERYTHING on the vhost... and of course it would get 404s for all of our other applications in subdirectories. &nbsp;For example, http://swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com/application would get a 404, because Rails isn't aware of /application. <br /><br />So maybe this configuration works when you use Passenger for all your projects, but in a mixed environment it is not enough.<br /><br />In the end, here's what worked:<br /><blockquote><code> &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; <br />&nbsp; ServerName swearing.com</code><br /><div><code>&nbsp; DocumentRoot /var/www/html&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; Alias /redmine /var/www/html/redmine/public</code><br /><code><br /></code><br /><code>&nbsp; &lt;Directory /&gt;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; Options FollowSymLinks&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; AllowOverride None&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &lt;/Directory&gt;</code><br /><code><br /></code><br /><code>&nbsp; &lt;Directory /var/www/html/redmine&gt;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; AllowOverride All&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Order allow,deny&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; allow from all&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &lt;/Directory&gt; </code><br /><code><br /></code><br /><code>&nbsp; &lt;Directory /var/www/html/redmine/public&gt;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; PassengerEnabled on&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; SetHandler none&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; PassengerAppRoot /var/www/html/redmine</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; RailsBaseURI /redmine </code><br /><code><br /></code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews&nbsp;</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; AllowOverride None</code></div><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Order allow,deny</code></div><br /><div><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; allow from all&nbsp;</code><br /><div><code>&nbsp; &lt;/Directory&gt;&nbsp;</code><br /><div><code><br />&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;<br /></code></div></div></div></blockquote>OK, I admit it - we cheated.  Instead of using Passenger and Rails' options to set their base directory, we used Apache to do it.  Sometimes the simplest solution is the best!
