While I was away over the weekend, I borked my iphone. &nbsp;I was running IOS 4.0, and I was having trouble with network connections.<br /><ul><li>The statusbar wouldn't reflect my actual connection status. &nbsp;WiFi connections would rarely show up in the statusbar, though I knew I was surfing wirelessly (my router at 10.10.10.1 was accessible to the phone, for starters...)</li><li>WiFi would periodically crash. &nbsp;In the middle of a good network connection, it would just. stop. working. &nbsp;I could go to System Preferences and see that WiFi was inexplicably disabled. &nbsp;If I tried to enable it, the switch animation would work, but no networks would be visible. &nbsp;Exiting and re-entering System Preferences would show WiFi disabled again.</li><li>Periodically all networking would crap out. &nbsp;The statusbar would show a good 3G connection, and ifconfig would show an IP... but the phone couldn't establish any connections, anywhere. &nbsp;</li></ul><div>Only rebooting ever solved any of the above problems. &nbsp;So this weekend I started to look into it, and it occurred to me that maybe SBSettings was interfering with networking - I periodically disable or enable Wifi in SBSettings, and it occurred to me that maybe there was a conflict there. &nbsp;So I uninstalled SBSettings, (noting that it unnecessarily included iphone zsrelay in the uninstall)...</div><div><br /></div><div>And my phone stopped getting signal. &nbsp;I had never seen anything like it before. &nbsp;It didn't show an operator, just 0 signal bars. &nbsp;It could get wifi, but couldn't access the Internet over it. &nbsp;In retrospect, I think the SBSettings uninstall borked my yellowsn0w unlock, and at the same time my networking subsystem in general wasn't working. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The solution was clear - I had to reinstall. &nbsp;I figured I would do an update at the same time, just in case the networking issue was related. &nbsp;So I spent this evening painfully updating to 4.1.2. &nbsp;For anyone who encounters the same kind of pain I did:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Don't bother with the latest Apple firmware. &nbsp;Firmware 4.2.1 is not easily crackable for the iphone 3gs yet, and besides, <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=12944">the most common way</a> to crack is to install the baseband from the iPad (06.15), which brings&nbsp;all sorts of problems, including broken GPS and disappearing battery charge.... deal breakers for most people IMO. &nbsp;</li><li>But when you try to install a non-current version of the firmware, iTunes won't let you! &nbsp;It phones home to the iTunes update servers to make sure that you are restoring to the most recent version. &nbsp;If it hears back that there is a MORE RECENT version than what you are trying to use, it will throw a message:</li></ul><blockquote><i>This device is not eligible for the requested build</i></blockquote><ul><li>If you use the older hack, and change your /etc/hosts so that gs.apple.com points to 127.0.0.1 (your own computer), it will complain that the update server is not responding, and refuse to go forward. &nbsp;This check involves an exchange of an encrypted key, which uses your unique iPhone's ID as one variable and Apple's passphrase as another. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.saurik.com/id/12">Saurik (of Cydia fame) set up a server</a>&nbsp;(note: really awesome post, recommended reading) to keep a backup of examples of successful SHSH key "handshakes" for each device, so you have to use the IP of this server instead.<br /></li></ul><br /></div>So here are the steps I had to follow, for reference:<br /><br /><ol><li>Download the 4.1.2 .ipsw for your iphone. &nbsp;I found it on binsearch by searching iPhone2,1_4.1_8B117_Restore.ipsw .</li><li>Download PwnageTool - get it from the torrent or the links on the official <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">devteam blog</a> site only! Everyone else is at best a scammer, or at worst a hack stealing the product of devteam's hard work.</li><li>Use <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1359246784/20102010-event">pwnagetool</a> to build yourself a custom version of the 4.1.2 firmware you just downloaded.</li><li>To foil Apple's update server check, add a line to etc/hosts pointing gs.apple.com to&nbsp;74.208.10.249 , Saurik's SHSH backup IP as of this writing. <br />If you have used Cydia before (and clicked the "make my life easier" button), this will be enough to get the restore going. &nbsp;If not, even a failed check of your validity for the firmware involves a key exchange, and having this IP in /etc/hosts will make sure that the SHSH key gets uploaded to Saurik's server. &nbsp;Give it about a day, and try again. &nbsp;Did I remember to link to Saurik's<a href="http://www.saurik.com/id/12"> really interesting blog post</a> about this? It explains a lot. &nbsp;If that doesn't help, try the <a href="http://thefirmwareumbrella.blogspot.com/">TinyUmbrella tool</a>.</li><li>When your custom .ipsw is written, put your iphone into DFU mode, open iTunes, and OPTION-click (for Macs) on the Restore link to select your custom firmware.</li><li>When your phone is restored and working, use Cydia to install ultrasn0w (the unlock).</li></ol>This took up MUCH to much of my evening. &nbsp;Once again, I found myself exercising creativity in swearing at computers.
