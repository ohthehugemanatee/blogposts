I'm really excited about a new session that I've been doing with my friend and colleague, [Adam Juran aka scaragucc](https://twitter.com/adamjurantenor): the Coder vs Themer Ultimate Grudge Match Smackdown Fight to the Death! The basic premise: we both start with the same wireframe of a front page to build. But *I'm only allowed to use the module layer, and Adam is only allowed to use the theme layer*. It's a really fun and entertaining way to play with the blurry lines between "coder" and "themer". We get the audience pretty pumped up, which is impressive for a session that's basically about watching other people code!

If you didn't catch it at [Drupal Dev Days in Szeged](http://szeged2014.drupaldays.org/program/sessions/themer-vs-coder-ultimate-grudge-smackdown-fight-death), or at [Drupalcamp Frankfurt](https://2014.drupalcamp-frankfurt.de/session/themer-vs-coder-ultimate-grudge-smackdown-fight-death), you're probably going to have to wait for Drupalcon Amsterdam to take part! But I do have a video of the session at Frankfurt, just to whet your appetite. :)

You can consider this a challenge: if any other themers out there want to challenge me to a coder vs themer style battle, I'll be keynoting at [Drupalcamp Helsinki](http://drupalcamp.fi) in a few weeks. I'll meet you there!
