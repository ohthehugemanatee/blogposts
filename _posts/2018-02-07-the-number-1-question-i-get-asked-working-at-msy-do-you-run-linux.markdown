<p>I&rsquo;ve had all of a week working at Microsoft, and so far it&rsquo;s been great. I&rsquo;ve managed to get my Linux daily driver machine working with almost all the MS internal systems (more on that in a separate post), and all the daily use applications have web or Linux versions available. So far, so good!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/ms-loves-linux.png" title="I see this banner all over the MS Intranet" ></p>

<p>But every time I&rsquo;ve asked for support, or visited IT, or encountered something that didn&rsquo;t work perfectly, I hear the same question: &ldquo;Why do you want to run open source software, anyway?&rdquo;  The question isn&rsquo;t asked with malice or condescention. It&rsquo;s asked with genuine curiosity. This is tremendous progress for Microsoft.</p>

<p>It is an important question, though: Why do I run Linux? Especially when it&rsquo;s not explicitly supported, when it entails more work, or more frustration. Why put myself through that?</p>

<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s none of your business what I run. I get all prickly when a service provider tries to get proscriptive about what I should be able to do <em>on my own computer</em>. On geeky principle, I should run the OS and configuration that suits me best. The service provider should implement standards so they don&rsquo;t have to care what I&rsquo;m running. Almost by definition, a service provider that limits what OS you can use, is Doing It Wrong.</p>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not the intent here. Take a deep breath, Cam. Microsoft allows you to run anything you like, as long as it&rsquo;s up to date with security patches. Their IT services only <em>support</em> Windows and OSX, but that&rsquo;s not unreasonable. Anyway, the question has come from all sorts of colleagues, not just IT. Deep breaths.</p>

<p>Once I calm my inner Stallman, here are the real reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I believe that either I own my devices, or they own me. I prefer that <em>I</em> make the decisions about how my computer should work &ndash; especially given what a large proportion of my life is spent working with this thing!</p></li>
<li><p>I trust open source software a lot more than proprietary software. Many eyes make better quality code, and better engineering under the hood.</p></li>
<li><p>It drives me crazy when something goes wrong with a proprietary product. There&rsquo;s usually no way to figure out the problem, know what I can do to improve it, or even how to report it appropriately. It&rsquo;s a black box of frustration.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that open source software exerts a strong equalizing force on the world. I &ldquo;vote with my behavior&rdquo; to support it.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In general, as more and more of our lives become computer controlled &ndash; today every car, airplane, pacemaker, and TV are computer-controlled &ndash; it becomes increasingly important that software is open. Given the chance, Google hearing aids would inject advertising into your dinner conversation, while Facebook would block sounds from companies that don&rsquo;t pay. Internet providers have recently won the right to tamper with your content, injecting ads, slowing competitors, and prioritizing their own websites. <strong>I believe that the best tools are controlled by their users.</strong> Open source is how we make that happen.</p>

<p>All these points seem pretty abstract, and they are. But they boil down to a very concrete impression for me: I am used to a computing experience where I am in control, and my device is a neutral extension of myself. So when I use a computer with an OS that someone else has dictated, it&rsquo;s very frustrating! I&rsquo;m frustrated by the ads that I can&rsquo;t block, the buttons that seem to be in the wrong place, the capabilities that are disabled because of someone elses priorities. It makes me feel like I&rsquo;m getting screwed. If your computer doesn&rsquo;t let you watch a region-coded DVD (Windows and OSX), you&rsquo;re getting screwed. If your phone doesn&rsquo;t let you block ads (unrooted IOS and Android), you&rsquo;re getting screwed. If your office suite restricts functionality based on what web browser you&rsquo;re using (Google Apps), you&rsquo;re getting screwed. <strong>I don&rsquo;t like to get screwed</strong>.</p>

<p>So, why do I insist on using open source software whenever possible? Because I feel screwed by proprietary consumer software.</p>
