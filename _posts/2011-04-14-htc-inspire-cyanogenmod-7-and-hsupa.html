About a month ago, I picked up my first Android phone: the HTC Inspire 4g, from AT&amp;T in the US. &nbsp;I determined to root it, install a custom OS, and laugh at all the poor saps who get bad battery life on HTC Sense.<br /><br />The first challenge is in the name. &nbsp;See, the HTC Inspire 4G is really just a rebranded HTC Desire HD, which is a tweaked HTC Desire, which is another name for the HTC Ace. <br /><br />I eventually got my head on straight, with the help of the good people at the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1018">xda-developers forum</a>, and in particular with the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=952352">Ace Hack Kit</a>&nbsp;which is linked there. &nbsp;Windows types might be interested in <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=961406">Bubby's Simple Root and S-Off</a> kit, which is apparently wonderful and easy to use. &nbsp;I wouldn't know, my PC is all the way on the other side of the room. &nbsp; I did this on my Mac, which is right in front of me.<br /><br />In a nutshell, here's what you do:<br /><br />1) Downgrade the ROM to an older version, from the international Desire HD. &nbsp;The old DHD had a vulnerability in the radio which we'll exploit, but otherwise it's very similar to the stock Inspire ROM.<br /><br />2) Use the vulnerability to get root (don't get excited, the fun stuff is all done by scripts).<br /><br />3) Use root to install the custom bootloader, which we need to make installing new ROMS easy.<br /><br />4) Upgrade the back to the stock Inspire radio firmware.<br /><br />5) Use the new custom bootloader to install the ROM of your choice. &nbsp;My choice was <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">Cyanogenmod 7</a>.<br /><br />The whole process is described well in the README that came with the Ace Hack Kit, but it's described even BETTER and more generically in the <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?title=HTC_Ace:_Recovery,_Radio_and_CyanogenMod">Cyanogenmod Wiki</a>. &nbsp;What a great resource - it's even got download links for <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?title=Support_Downloads#HTC_Ace">every radio firmware version</a> for each phone!<br /><br />Everything went smoothly... but I did this whole process after I had already left the US. &nbsp; I was actually in one of the countries where I'm on roaming, so I don't use my cellular data... I just came back to my apartment in France, to find that cellular data is stuck on EDGE mode. &nbsp;That gets me about 1/5 of the speed available on the network, and it gets me very frustrated.<br /><br />So I stopped by my mobile provider to see if it was an issue with the plan I'm subscribed to. &nbsp;Apparently not; they were just as puzzled as I. &nbsp;I've pored over Cyanogen's settings, but no luck. &nbsp;So tonight I brought out the big guns.<br /><br />First I backed everything up, like a good little boy. &nbsp;I used Titanium Backup, and boy I hope it works.<br /><br />Then I tried just re-flashing the Cyanogenmod ROM. &nbsp;Actually, I flashed an update from RC7 to the full release, using the ROM Manager program. &nbsp;No improvement.<br /><br />So I downloaded a special script to wipe ALL of the non-user directories, and ran THAT from Recovery, THEN re-installed Cyanogenmod. &nbsp;No improvement.<br /><br />Then I started really hunting around in forums. &nbsp;It seems that <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=12839710&amp;postcount=2976">some people have trouble</a> getting HSUPA going after this unlock process I described above. &nbsp;They have good network connectivity when they downgrade, but after upgrading back to AT&amp;T stock firmware, they get stuck on EDGE. &nbsp;So the recommended solution is to re-downgrade, then skip the AT&amp;T stock firmware, and re-upgrade to something newer/better.<br /><br />So that's what I tried.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck in a boot loop... and when it DOES boot, I still only get EDGE. &nbsp;I'm starting to worry that the Inspire is limited to picking up US HSPDA+ frequencies, and just doesn't "get" the EU frequencies. &nbsp;In that case, maybe I'll have to try some of the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=952582">Desire HD kernels</a> which have been hacked for Inspire hardware...<br /><br />So now I'm left - you guessed it - swearing at yet another computer.
