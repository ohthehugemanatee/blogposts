Lately I've been getting hit by an odd kernel bug on one of the servers I maintain. &nbsp;It's discussed in some depth on <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/614853">Launchpad</a>, but the gist is that when trying to find an idle cpu for a new thread, the scheduler divides by cpu_power. &nbsp;On EC2 instances, it's possible for cpu_power to be 0, which causes a divide by zero kernel crash. &nbsp;<u>Why</u> cpu_power is 0 is still an unknown; this should never be the case. &nbsp;But in the meantime, there's a patch committed to ec2 kernel 2.6.32-313.26 which adds a check before running this division. &nbsp;If cpu_power is 0, it waits a bit and tries again. &nbsp;I believe it also adds a kernel yell, to help with tracking down the underlying problem. &nbsp;In the meantime, this bug was crashing one of my instances.<br /><br />So it's time to update the kernel. &nbsp;This should be easy, right? &nbsp;apt-get dist-upgrade seems to do it... but if you reboot, uname -r will tell you you're still on the old kernel. &nbsp;That's when the swearing begins.<br /><br />You see, cloud based hosting is a very seductive thing. &nbsp;Those servers LOOK like real servers. &nbsp;They FEEL like real servers. &nbsp;And in 99% of all ways they ACT like real servers. &nbsp;But they are not real servers. &nbsp;And that 1% of difference is where all of the pain comes in. &nbsp;As an aside, succumbing to this illusion is setting yourself up for disaster with any cloud based server.<br /><br />One of the differences is that you don't have a real boot sector, or a real BIOS. &nbsp;Everything you know about the first steps of booting a system has to go out the window. &nbsp;Amazon uses Xen virtualization, which means that all that boot stuff you know should be replaced with <a href="http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/PvGrub">PVGrub</a>. &nbsp;Actually, don't bother learning too much about it; we're just interested in upgrading our kernel.<br /><br />Amazon <a href="http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/user_specified_kernels.pdf">documents this in a PDF</a>, which is a bit painful to work through. &nbsp;I've walked you through my process here.<br /><br />The first thing to know is that you need kernel support for PVGrub (or PV-Grub, because they're inconsistent with the naming). &nbsp;Don't sweat this too much, pvgrub is supported in most big distros. &nbsp;Amazon claims to have tested with these ones:<br /><br />• Fedora 8‐9 Xen kernels<br />• Fedora 13 (2.6.33.6‐147 and higher)<br />• SLES/openSUSE 10.x, 11.0, 11.1 Xen<br />• SLES/openSUSE 11.x EC2 Variant<br />• Ubuntu EC2 Variant  kernels<br />• RHEL 5.x kernels <br />• RHEL 6.x kernels<br />• CentOS 5.x kernels<br />• Gentoo<br /><br />Ubuntu, at least, is smart enough to install the EC2 variant kernels in that apt-get dist-upgrade you ran earlier, so that much is done for you already. <br /><br />The next thing you need to know is that PVGrub has a strong historical connection to PXE booters. &nbsp;If you haven't worked with network booting, that's what PXE does for you. &nbsp;The main difference is that you have to go back to having separate initrd and vmlinuz images in your /boot directory. &nbsp;To be honest, I never trusted booting without vmlinuz, so this made me a little happy. &nbsp;It made me even happier to see that apt-get had dropped both images in there for me already. <br /><br />Now you have to create a grub boot list. &nbsp;On a real server, this is the file which tells Grub which kernels are options for booting. &nbsp;Create /boot/grub/menu.lst with the following content:<br /><br /><blockquote><code> default 0</code><code> timeout 3<br /></code><code> title EC2<br /></code><code> root (hd0)<br /></code><code> kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-314-ec2 root=/dev/sda1</code><code> initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-314-ec2</code></blockquote><br />Those are the vmlinuz and initrd filenames that I got from my update - since you're following this guide somewhere in the future, those version numbers will be different. &nbsp;Have a quick look to see what you've got in /boot , and replace those filenames in your own menu.lst.<br /><br />That's it - but in order to make this active, you have to bundle it as an AMI and start a new instance. &nbsp;This actually enforces a very good, conservative workflow. &nbsp;You get to run your updates, and test the kernel update on a non-live environment before moving your live IP over. <br /><br />Because you're using a non-standard kernel, you do have to manually specify a few things in your AMI build process. &nbsp;Here's the run-down:<br /><blockquote><code> # ec2-bundle-vol -r [ARCH] -d [DESTINATION] -p [AMI-NAME] -u [AWS-USERID] -k [KEYFILE] -c [CERTFILE] -s 10240 -e [EXCEPTIONS] --kernel [KERNEL-ID]</code></blockquote><div>This is your standard <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/dg/2006-10-01/CLTRG-ami-bundle-vol.html">ec2-bundle-vol</a> command. &nbsp;If you don't use this too often, here are the variables:<br /><br /><ul><li>[ARCH] is the CPU architecture for your instance. &nbsp;It's either i386 or x86_64</li><li>[DESTINATION] is the temporary filespace to use when building the AMI. &nbsp;<b>Do not do this on the root partition</b>. &nbsp;I use /mnt , which is the 100gb EBS volume provided with the instance.</li><li>[AMI-NAME] is the name for the AMI. It can be anything, I used production-kernel-2.6.32-314-ec2</li><li>[AWS-USERID] Your AWS userID number. &nbsp;You can find it in the top right corner of the AWS account page.</li><li>[KEYFILE] and [CERTFILE] are your AWS keyfile and certificate files, which are used to authenticate with AWS.</li><li>[EXCEPTIONS] is a comma delineated list of directories to leave out of the image file. &nbsp;In my case this is /mnt,/tmp,/ebs . &nbsp;Note that if you leave /tmp out, the tempdir created automatically will have incorrect permissions.</li></ul><div>[KERNEL-ID] doesn't fit into a bullet point. &nbsp;This is an ID that identifies the architecture of the instance for Amazon's bootloader, and it's important. &nbsp;Choose the right KID depending on your CPU, instance type, and region:</div><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><b>32-bit Instance</b></td><td><b>64-bit Instance</b></td><td><b>32-bit EBS</b></td><td><b>64-bit EBS</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>US-East-1</b></td><td>aki-407d9529</td><td>aki-427d952b</td><td>aki-4c7d9525</td><td>aki-4e7d9527</td></tr><tr><td><b>US-West-1</b></td><td>aki-99a0f1dc</td><td>aki-9ba0f1de</td><td>aki-9da0f1d8</td><td>aki-9fa0f1da</td></tr><tr><td><b>EU-West-1</b></td><td>aki-4deec439</td><td>aki-4feec43b</td><td>aki-47eec433</td><td>aki-41eec435</td></tr><tr><td><b>AP-SouthEast-1</b></td><td>aki-13d5aa41</td><td>aki-11d5aa43</td><td>aki-6fd5aa3d</td><td>aki-6dd5aa3f</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><br /></div><div>One important note: in Amazon's PDF documentation, they use an odd character set. &nbsp;This means that the hyphen in the middle of the AKI is not a unicode hyphen. &nbsp;I spent more than an hour trying to figure out why my AMI was complaining of an invalid AKI over this! &nbsp;Either copy and paste the ID from this blog post, or type it in by hand. <br /><br />From here on in ,it's a standard AMI upload and register process:<br /><br /><blockquote><code> # ec2-upload-bundle -b [BUCKET-LOCATION] -m [MANIFEST] -a [KEY] -s [SECRET KEY]</code></blockquote><br /><br /><ul><li>[BUCKET-LOCATION] is the name of an S3 bucket where you want to save this AMI. &nbsp;If the bucket doesn't exist, ec2-upload-bundle will create it.</li><li>[MANIFEST] is the manifest file created with ec2-bundle-vol above. &nbsp;It'll be in the same directory, with the same name, just with the extension .manifest.xml . &nbsp;For example, /mnt/production-kernel-2.6.32-314-ec2.manifest.xml</li><li>[KEY] and [SECRET KEY] are your AWS key and secret key, which you can get from your AWS Account area.</li></ul><br /><code><br /># ec2-register –-name [AMI NAME] [S3 MANIFEST]<br /></code><br /><br /><br /><ul><li>[AMI NAME] is the name of your AMI (duh)</li><li>[S3 MANIFEST] is the path of the manifest file you just uploaded, including the bucket path, on S3. &nbsp;For example prod-upgrade/production-kernel-2.6.32-314-ec2.manifest.xml</li></ul>Now start your new AMI, and test like hell before replacing that production instance!&nbsp;</div></div></div>
